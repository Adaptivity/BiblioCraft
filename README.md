===========
This repository for now will be to catalog and maintain all the language support files. 
Please feel free to read over translations and commit updates if you think something should be changed or
to help keep up with my update. If you can translate a language not on this list, then please by all means 
either submit a .lang file on here or on my forum and I shall add it to the github.
